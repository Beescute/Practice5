# Practice5
Task:

1. Create a clDate class (Day, Month, Year â€“ private) compatible with the myDate structure created in practical work No. 1.

2. Implement the default constructor, as well as constructors with parameters for initialization based on various data types, a destructor (if necessary), setDate(), getDate() for cclDate operation

3. Create static objects of the cldDate class using each created constructor of the clDate class, as well as a dynamic object.

4. Create an object named dcclass clDate based on the copy constructor. Increase the date by 5 (days). To check the validity of a new date (if a new date is not allowed, print a message and leave the previous one).

 

5. Create a slRecord class based on the type (Record structure) of the first practical.

6. Use string as a string type

7. Each of the four fields of the Record Record (members-class data) to place

a. The first field of the record is the default visibility section

b. The second field of the record is in public

c. The third field of the record is in private

d. The fourth field of the record is in protected

e. The fifth field of the record (an object of the clDate class) is in protected

8. Create a default constructor, a constructor (file name), a constructor (Record*), if necessary, methods for reading/writing data values of class members

9. Create 1 static and 1 dynamic objects of the clRecord class

10. Create an array of objects of the clRecord class

11. Initialize an array of objects with the values of table rows from the practical 0.
